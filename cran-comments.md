## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Addressed the Windows and Debian notes for month-old build time stamps.
* Fixed output of `run_schedule()` to correctly handle counting of successful runs when pipelines are skipped.
* Performance improvements to `build_schedule()` (#101).
* Tested on version 4.4.1 of R.
