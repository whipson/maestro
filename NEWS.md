# maestro 0.4.0.9000

### Breaking changes

- Column `script_path` is no longer returned from `get_status()` or `get_schedule()` to accommodate pipelines spanning multiple different scripts.

# maestro 0.3.0

This version refactors much of the code base to rely on R6 classes for pipelines and schedules. Pay careful attention to the breaking changes to see how existing code may be impacted.

### Breaking changes

- Schedules are now represented as an R6 object of class `<MaestroSchedule>`. `build_schedule()` returns a MaestroSchedule object that can be passed to `run_schedule()` as normal. To access the schedule table run `get_schedule()`.

- `run_schedule()` no longer returns a list of `$status` and `$artifacts` but now returns/modifies the MaestroSchedule object. Status can be accessed using `get_status(schedule)` and artifacts via `get_artifacts(schedule)`

- `suggest_orch_frequency()` now takes a `<MaestroSchedule>` object.

- Data `example_schedule` removed from the package.

- Skipped pipelines are no longer shown in the CLI output of `run_schedule()`.

- It is now required that all pipeline names are unique. The names of each maestro pipeline function must be unique across the project to support the implementation of DAGs. `build_schedule()` will abort if any non-unique names are detected.

### New features

- Added functions `get_schedule()`, `get_status()`, and `get_artifacts()` for interacting with `<MaestroSchedule>` objects.

- Added function `invoke()` to instantly run a pipeline in a schedule.

### Bug Fixes

- Error messaging is clearer when running functions that wrap around purrr iterators (#115).

# maestro 0.2.0

### New features

- New tags `maestroHours`, `maestroDays`, and `maestroMonths` allows running of pipelines on specific hours of day, days of week, days of month, or months of year (#100).

- `maestroFrequency` tag now accepts the values hourly, daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly. Argument `orch_frequency` to `run_schedule()` also accepts these values.

### Minor changes

- Changed from `example_schedule` data the pipeline with a schedule of 1 minute to 30 minutes in keeping with best practices for minimum pipeline frequency.

- `suggest_orch_frequency` now uses the smallest interval between any two pipelines (#99).

### Bug Fixes

- Error messages on unintentional overwrites from `create_*()` functions correctly reference name of path or directory that was to be overwritten.

- Fixed cli output of `run_schedule()` to not show skipped pipelines in the next run portion.

# maestro 0.1.2

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed cli output to correctly handle counting of successful runs when pipelines are skipped.

- Performance improvements to `build_schedule()` (#101).

# maestro 0.1.1

### Breaking changes

- Creater functions `create_pipeline()` and `create_maestro` no longer have default arguments for the path to where the scripts are created. Users must explicitly define these paths.

- Argument `log_file` in `run_schedule()` no longer defaults to `./maestro.log` but instead defaults to `NULL`.

### Minor changes

- Creater functions `create_*` now take a boolean `overwrite` argument to make the overwriting of existing pipelines, projects, and orchestrators more explicit.

# maestro 0.1.0

- Initial CRAN submission

# maestro 0.0.4

### Bug fixes

- Fixed the output of the next run for pipelines (#90)

# maestro 0.0.3

### Breaking changes

- `run_schedule()` now returns a list with status and artifacts instead of just a data.frame of the status. Artifacts are any values returned from pipelines. Pipelines that return nothing will have no artifacts.

### Major changes

- New helper function `suggest_orch_frequency()` to provide a suggestion of what frequency to use for the orchestrator.

### Minor changes

- Start and end times are now reported from functions that result in an error in single core only (#82).

### Bug fixes

- CLI output from `run_schedule()` now correctly outputs the total number of pipelines (#81) and correctly outputs number of errors.

# maestro 0.0.2

### Breaking changes

- maestroFrequency tag now adheres to a more human-readable format like "1 day", "2 hours", "4 weeks", etc.

- `orch_frequency` argument in `run_schedule()` also takes more human-readable format identical to maestroFrequency tag.

- maestroInterval tag removed

- `orch_interval` argument to `run_schedule()` removed.

- `create_maestro()` and `create_orchestrator()` now use the argument `type` instead of `extension` for defining what script type to use for the orchestrator.

- Changed `last_parsing_errors()` to `last_build_errors()`; changed functions of the form `last_runtime_*()` to `last_run_*()`.

### Major changes

- Additional columns added to the output of `run_schedule()`: `pipeline_started` and `pipeline_ended` to indicate the start and end times of a pipeline execution; `next_run` to indicate when the next run should be based on the frequency of the pipeline and orchestrator.

- Pipelines now show as skipped if they are not scheduled.

- Added hex logo

### Minor changes

- Backend improvements to schedule checking

- Timestamps are formatted to specified time zone.

- `run_schedule()` cli output suggests to use `last_run_errors()` or `last_run_warnings()` if any errors or warnings were found.
